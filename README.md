The bot is designed to meet the needs of my Discord server. It is designed to work on all servers provided that the configuration is suitable

The goal is to have a versatile bot to simplify each task and replace other bots, allowing to minimize the number of non-human members, It therefore includes simple commands as well as complicated commands.

To launch the bot on the server, you must use the command "nohup python Chillr.py > Chillr.log 2>&1 &", to stop it, you must use the kill command with the PID, obtainable with the command "ps aux | grep Chillr.py"
